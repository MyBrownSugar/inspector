Smart mapping based on ROS 

This system of stereographic inspection of the internal space of the pipeline allows you to build a three-dimensional map of the investigated object.  The usefulness of the project lies in the possibility of finding the pipeline by overlaying the scanned area on a two-dimensional map of the area.  It is proposed to use an accelerometer and magnetometer to determine the absolute course of the moving platform and determine the position of the robot based on the rotation of the actuators.
