The project is dedicated to working with a system for detecting mobile robots. The functioning of computer vision algorithms is based on working with the opencv library for python. At the first stage of the project, three circular beacons are used to determine the coordinates and direction of the robot. The control of the mobile platform is realized by sending serial commands to the serial port of the controlling controller via bluetooth.
